Demos! Demos!

- [x] Image Capture: https://rawgit.com/yellowdoge/demos/master/imagecapture.html
- [x] Media Recorder: https://rawgit.com/yellowdoge/demos/master/mediarecorder.html
- [x] &lt;video/audio&gt;.captureStream(): https://rawgit.com/yellowdoge/demos/master/videoelementcapture.html

Some older&simpler ones:

- [x] [Simplest camera capture and display](https://rawgit.com/yellowdoge/demos/master/gum_simple.html)
- [x] [Single camera multiple resolutions](https://rawgit.com/yellowdoge/demos/master/gum_resolutions.html)
- [x] [Simultanenous opening of all available cameras](https://rawgit.com/yellowdoge/demos/master/gum_multi.html)

And only partially related:

- [x] [Geolocation](https://rawgit.com/yellowdoge/demos/master/geolocation.html)

These previous demos are curt and not fancy: the idea is to experiment in a
snippet-fashion with the APIs mentioned. _Much_ better demos are those in
https://simple.info:
- [x] [Image Capture: simple.info/ic](https://simpl.info/imagecapture/)
- [x] [Media Recorder: simple.info/mr](http://simpl.info/mediarecorder/)

- [x] [Media Capture using &lt;input&gt;](http://simpl.info/mediacapture/)
